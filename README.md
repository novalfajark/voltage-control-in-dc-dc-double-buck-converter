Nature provides renewable energy that can be used continuously. Micro-hydro, one of the renewable energy sources, is very advanced. A small amount of water energy is converted into electrical energy through a micro-hydro process, which drives the local grid. The micro hydro power system is directly connected to a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) and produces three-phase power on a small scale. Traditional converters produce unstable output voltages such as AC-DC buck converters are often used, this method has considerable drawbacks. A DC-DC converter is needed to produce stable and highly efficient electrical energy. DC-DC converters come in a variety of designs. Advanced control techniques are used to create outputs that meet power supply requirements. This document proposes a dual buck DC-DC converter. To control the PMSG output voltage which is affected by water flow, a double buck converter is used as a PMSG output control, this double buck DC-DC converter is used. This converter has a stable and continuous output voltage. The simple packaged double buck DC-DC converter has the advantages of high efficiency and stability as a DC power supply
